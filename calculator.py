#This script makes functions for basic math operations

#This defines a function that takes two inputs: a and b, and returns a times b  
def multiply(a,b):
    return a * b

#This defines a function that takes two inputs: a and b, and returns a plus b  
def add(a,b):
    return a + b

#This defines a function that takes two inputs: a and b, and returns a minus b  
def subtract(a,b):
    return a - b

#This defines a function that takes two inputs: a and b, and returns a divded by b  
def divide(a,b):
    return a / b
